# Robot_Arena
A mini game I developed for class, involving fighting robots and trying to survive.

You were captured by XR-36 planet residents and thrown into an area filled with killer robots. To make things more exciting for the audience, they gave you a remote that has 1/2 chance to control a robot to move to the direction you commanded.

In order to survive, you need to use the remote and control them to destroy themselves - by making them hit the wall!

@ is where you are standing. * and the edges of the area are walls that you can use. The number on the grid suggests the channel of the robot present on that grid. you can use n/e/s/w to move north, east, south, and west. x gives you the recommanded safe move, and nothing will make you stand where you are at.

Follow the instructions and fight for your life!
